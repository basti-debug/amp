# amp
In this project, I developed my own Home 4.1 Audio Amplifier, it is a class AB amplifier which I designed and built. 
It is controlled by an esp32, which controls the Volume, Orientation and Inputs. 
In the future, the addition of the screen will add a graphical UI, which will display a variety of information. 

Finally, I want to integrate the controls of the amp, into google home, or if this is not possible, on a website so the amp can be controlled from the distance.
